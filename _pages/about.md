With experience in clinical, epidemiological, and simulation-based studies, I apply statistical modeling and machine learning to biomedical and public health problems.

I am particularly interested in reproducible research, causal inference, and the interface between statistics and real-world medical decision-making.
 
I am seeking opportunities in academia (PhD) as well as industry settings including CROs, pharma, hospitals, and startups.
  
I am a biostatistician with a Master’s degree (M2) in biostatistics, with training in statistical inference, modeling, and data analysis for clinical and epidemiological research.

My work focuses on applying principled statistical methods to real-world health data, including clinical and observational studies, with careful attention to assumptions, uncertainty quantification, and
interpretability.

I have experience working with clinical, epidemiological, and simulated datasets, and I am particularly interested in survival analysis, longitudinal data analysis, and causal considerations in observational
studies.

I am currently seeking PhD opportunities and applied biostatistics positions in CROs, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, or health-focused startups.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
