 I am a biostatistician with a Master’s degree (M2) in biostatistics, with training in statistical inference, modeling, and data analysis for clinical and epidemiological research.

My work focuses on applying principled statistical methods to real-world health data, including clinical and observational studies, with careful attention to assumptions, uncertainty quantification, and
interpretability.

I have experience working with clinical, epidemiological, and simulated datasets, and I am particularly interested in survival analysis, longitudinal data analysis, and causal considerations in observational
studies.

I am currently seeking PhD opportunities and applied biostatistics positions in CROs, pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, or health-focused startups.
